# Morser

A comprehensive morse code learning and practicing tool for the blind.

## ðŸš§ Web/JavaScript Rewrite In Progress

This repository is being rewritten from BGT (Blastbay Game Toolkit) to a modern web-based JavaScript application for better accessibility and cross-platform support.

## Documentation

- **[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)** - Complete feature list and technical specification for the web/JS rewrite
- **[src/readme english.txt](src/readme%20english.txt)** - Original English documentation (reference)
- **[src/readme russian.txt](src/readme%20russian.txt)** - Original Russian documentation (reference)

## Sound Assets

The `/src/sounds/` directory contains all the audio files used for morse code playback:
- Dot and dash sounds (wave and telegraph modes)
- Start/end indicators
- Beep notifications

These assets will be used in the web implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Review and edit FEATURES.md with any additional requirements
2. Implement the web/JS version following the technical architecture outlined in FEATURES.md
3. Ensure full accessibility compliance with screen readers and braille displays

## Original Implementation

The original BGT implementation has been removed. All features and functionality have been documented in FEATURES.md for the web/JS rewrite.
